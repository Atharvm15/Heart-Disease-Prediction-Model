## Cell 1: Importing Necessary Libraries

In this cell, we import necessary libraries for data manipulation and modeling, and we prepare the dataset for model training.

- **numpy (np)**: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It provides support for mathematical functions and operations on arrays, making it essential for numerical operations and array manipulation in machine learning tasks.

- **pandas (pd)**: Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides data structures like DataFrame and Series, which allow for easy handling of structured data. Pandas is commonly used for data preprocessing, exploration, and feature engineering in machine learning projects.

- **sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split**: This function from scikit-learn is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. It helps in evaluating the model's performance on unseen data and preventing overfitting by providing a separate dataset for testing.

- **sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression**: Logistic regression is a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. This class from scikit-learn implements logistic regression for classification tasks.

- **sklearn.metrics.accuracy_score**: The accuracy_score function from scikit-learn calculates the accuracy of the model predictions by comparing predicted labels with true labels. It is a common metric used to evaluate the performance of classification models and provides a simple measure of model accuracy.

## Cell 2: Loading of Data
This line of code reads the diabetes dataset from a CSV file named 'heart_disease_data.csv' and stores it in a pandas DataFrame named 'heart_data'. 

Pandas' `read_csv()` function is used to read the contents of the CSV file into a DataFrame. This function automatically detects the delimiter used in the file (usually a comma) and parses the data into rows and columns. The resulting DataFrame allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the dataset, making it a popular choice for working with structured data in Python.


## Cell 3: Data Exploration and Preprocessing

This cell focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preparing the dataset for model training.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis

- **Printing First 5 Rows**: We use the `head()` function to print the first 5 rows of the dataset. This helps in understanding the structure and format of the data, as well as identifying any potential issues or anomalies.

- **Printing Last 5 Rows**: Similarly, we use the `tail()` function to print the last 5 rows of the dataset. This provides additional insight into the dataset, particularly regarding the ordering of records and any potential changes or trends over time.

- **Printing Dimensions**: We use the `shape` attribute to determine the number of rows and columns in the dataset. This information is essential for understanding the size and structure of the dataset, which influences subsequent data processing and analysis steps.

- **Getting Data Information**: We use the `info()` method to obtain information about the dataset, including data types, non-null counts, and memory usage. This helps in identifying the presence of missing values and understanding the overall composition of the dataset.

- **Checking for Missing Values**: We use the `isnull().sum()` method to check for missing values in each column of the dataset. This is crucial for identifying any data inconsistencies or gaps that may need to be addressed during preprocessing.

- **Statistical Measures**: We use the `describe()` method to compute statistical measures (e.g., mean, median, min, max) for numerical columns in the dataset. This provides insight into the distribution and variability of the data, which can inform feature selection and modeling decisions.

#### Data Preparation

- **Separating Features and Target**: We separate the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (Y). Features contain all columns except the target variable 'target', which is dropped using the `drop()` method along the columns axis. This step prepares the data for model training, with features serving as input variables and the target variable as the variable to be predicted.

- **Printing Features and Target**: We print the features (X) and the target variable (Y) to verify the separation and ensure that the data is correctly partitioned. This helps in confirming that the data is ready for subsequent modeling steps.

## Cell 4: Data Splitting and Model Training

This cell focuses on splitting the data into training and testing sets and training a logistic regression model.

#### Data Splitting

- **Train-Test Split**: We use the `train_test_split()` function from scikit-learn to split the features (X) and target variable (Y) into training and testing sets. The `test_size` parameter specifies the proportion of the dataset to include in the test split, while `stratify=Y` ensures that the class distribution is preserved in the splits. The `random_state` parameter is set for reproducibility.

- **Printing Dimensions**: We print the dimensions of the features before and after splitting to verify that the data has been partitioned correctly. This helps ensure that the training and testing sets are appropriately sized for model training and evaluation.

#### Model Training

- **Initializing Logistic Regression Model**: We instantiate a logistic regression model using the `LogisticRegression()` constructor from scikit-learn. Logistic regression is a commonly used algorithm for binary classification tasks.

- **Training with Training Data**: We train the logistic regression model using the training features (`X_train`) and corresponding labels (`Y_train`) via the `fit()` method. This step involves learning the parameters of the logistic regression model to make predictions on new data.

#### Model Evaluation

- **Accuracy on Training Data**: We calculate the accuracy of the trained model on the training dataset by comparing the predicted labels (`X_train_prediction`) with the true labels (`Y_train`) using the `accuracy_score()` function. This metric provides an indication of how well the model fits the training data.

- **Accuracy on Test Data**: Similarly, we compute the accuracy of the model on the testing dataset (`X_test`, `Y_test`). This evaluates the model's generalization performance on unseen data and provides insight into its ability to make accurate predictions on new observations.

#### Prediction on New Data

- **Prediction on New Data**: We demonstrate how to use the trained logistic regression model to predict whether a new data point corresponds to a person with heart disease or not. The input data is converted to a numpy array and reshaped as needed, and then the model predicts the label based on the input.

- **Print Prediction**: We print the predicted label to indicate whether the person is predicted to have heart disease or not, based on the logistic regression model's classification.
